# Divide and Conquer Algorithm
In this tutorial, you will learn how the divide and conquer algorithm works. We will also compare the divide and conquer approach versus other approaches to solve a recursive problem.

A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by

breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining them to get the desired output.

## How Divide and Conquer Algorithms Work?
Here are the steps involved:
### Divide: 
      Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
      
### Conquer: 
      Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, then solve it directly.
      
### Combine: 
      Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.


## Advantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm
The complexity for the multiplication of two matrices using the naive method is O(n3), whereas using the divide and conquer approach (i.e. Strassen's matrix multiplication) is O(n2.8074). This approach also simplifies other problems, such as the Tower of Hanoi.
This approach is suitable for multiprocessing systems.
It makes efficient use of memory caches.
