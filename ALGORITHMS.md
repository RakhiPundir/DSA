## What are Algorithms?
Informally, an algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem. They are essentially a solution.
Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.

# Data structures and algorithms (DSA) goes through solutions to standard problems in detail and gives you an insight into how efficient it is to use each one of them. It also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. This enables you to choose the best of various choices.

Use of Data Structures and Algorithms to Make Your Code Scalable
# Time is precious.

More on Scalability
Scalability is scale plus ability, which means the quality of an algorithm/system to handle the problem of larger size.

# Memory is expensive
Memory is not always available in abundance. While dealing with code/system which requires you to store or produce a lot of data, it is critical for your algorithm to save the usage of memory wherever possible. For example: While storing data about people, you can save memory by storing only their date of birth, not their age. You can always calculate it on the fly using their date of birth and current date.
